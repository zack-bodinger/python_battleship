# python_battleship
battleship game from codecademy with added features


Each player gets 5 turns to guess 5 randomly generated battleship locations. 

Room to improve: 
-validate user input (currently crashes with non-integer input)
-ensure 5 ship locales are unique
-allow users to place ships and play against AI
